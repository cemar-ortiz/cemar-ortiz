- 👋 Hi, I’m César Martinez

- 👀 I’m interested in building software solutions for problems in areas such as banking, finance and marketing. Currently I'm working at an IT consulting firm and previously I was doing bioinformatics research on a genomics lab.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, c#, python, API REST, machine learning, AI, algorithms and data structures (among other things). I'm generally trying to stay updated on the latest technologies,
but I dedicate most of my time on studying the fundamentals to develop high quality software. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning and web development projects.
